# PigeonGame
Strongly considering Pigeon Game as the final name for this project

Pigeon Game is a game about pigeons involving the following, but not only the following (and not necessarily all of the following):

- pigeons
- controlling both wings independently
- lots of ragdolling
- physics that overreact to Pigeon Impact
- competitive stuff-collecting
- pigeon poop that can hit other players
- owls
- political commentary using the allegory of pigeons vs. owls classism
- toon shaders
- toon shaders
- individual feathers on each bird as game objects with physics and colliders that DO collide with each other
- low frame rate
- REM, riding the back of a mighty golden pigeon that can go through walls and its chirps sound like lo-fi hip hop
- Boats, hundreds of them, rising with the tide
- toon shaders
